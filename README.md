✌️ My name is Dilmurod, I am 20 years old. I am passionate about the backend side of development and currently studying at INHA University in Tashkent

💻 I have been engaged in backend development for more than a year, in particular in Php. I have created small projects in vanilla Php, as well as in frameworks such as Yii2 and Laravel. But my main interest in Laravel and currently I am working on a blog in Larvael as a side project while working at a full-time job in Tashkent. 

🔮 In the future, I am planning to build new projects by learning new languages like Python and Go.
